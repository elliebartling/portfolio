        <h4 class="subtitle">user experience designer + developer</h4>

        <p>I help organizations engage their users and build their brands through <a href="work/at-the-fork">interactive design</a>. I'm a huge geek for all things cognitive science, user research, economics, front-end web tech, design, branding, and dogs.</p>

        <p>Currently, I work with an amazing team at an Austin, TX creative agency called <a target="_blank" href="http://www.emergentorder.com">Emergent Order</a> that’s dedicated to making awesome things, including apps, websites, digital magazines, identity + branding redesign, and any kind of video production under the sun.</p>

        <p>One of my favorite recent design projects: a 360-degree virtual reality app to promote awareness about the living conditions of America's farm animals. We released the app in tandem with a feature documentary, a website (which I designed and built), and a marketing campaign. See the final version at <a target="_blank" href="http://attheforkfilm.com/app">At the Fork Film</a>, and my <a href="">case-study here</a>.</p>

        <h2 class="title">I design, build, & write &mdash; a lot.</h2>
        <p>In addition to designing, I also build and write — a lot. Whether I’m prototyping animations, testing the limits of potential frameworks for a project, writing creative briefs, drawing up user research reports, or crafting proposals for new clients, I’ve found that being a designer involves a <i>lot</i> more than designing.</p>

        <p>After four years in the industry, I’ve found that honing other skills makes me a much better designer and team player: learning how javascript routers work has made me a better information architect; playing with Vue.js has taught me the power of modularity and component-driven design; honing my writing has made me better at interviewing, and finding and communicating insights from user research; optimizing pages for load speed has made me better at making smarter tradeoffs between form and function; and spending hours working through code has made be a better colleague, communicator, and project manager (there is nothing quite so demoralizing as getting trapped in Dependency Hell, and nothing quite as frustrating as spending time on a feature that ultimately isn’t needed).</p>

          <!-- <li><em>Texas Public Policy Foundation</em></li> -->
          <p>I started my career at a non-profit, public policy organization where I designed graphics, documents & posters, crafted press releases, tracked media hits, wrote scripts, shot interviews, recorded podcasts, edited in Final Cut, and managed relationships with 8,000+ followers on social media. I also project-managed the internal side of an award-winning website redesign, and founded the in-house analytics program (to this day, the program is still colloquially called "Holodeck" &mdash; for which I proudly claim credit <img width="20px" src="dist/images/noun_54427.png"/>).</p>

          <p>I started at Emergent Order as an assistant in video production, but quickly found my niche designing, building & managing interactive digital experiences. At EO, I've led design projects on Virtual Reality apps, content site overhauls, organizational re-branding projects, and marketing campaigns.</p>

          <h2 class="title">Quick Project: Tracking video views in Airtable</h2>
          <p>Emergent Order started life as a video production house. We’ve made award-winning documentaries, television ads, parody videos, mini-docs — oh, and music videos featuring rap battles between dead economists.</p>

          <p>As our list of multi-million-view hits grows, it’s become increasingly cumbersome to track exactly how many views EO content has gotten in aggregate — so, with the help of our favorite internal database app, I decided to write a quick node.js script that aggregates our views for us.</p>

          <p>UI design in the high-fashion world is very complex. As Cat — a super friendly, brilliant industrial designer who’s breaking into the jewelry scene later this year — explained to me, there is a very weird and nebulous line to balance between minimalism and usability. Sites are designed to be minimalist, sparse, and in some cases, outright confusing — on purpose.</p>

<p>Utterly baffling for me, a UX designer, whose entire job is about making things easy to use. The initial market research for this project was a bizarro, Alice-in-Wonder-Land-style journey into a world that really hinges on the model of, “If you have to ask [how it works], you can’t afford it” — but the more I dug, the more I realized that minimalism and hidden features were really important brand signals to the kinds of customers who might buy out your entire line.</p>
