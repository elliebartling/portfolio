# Should designers learn to code? 
Yep. Yup. Yes. Definitely yes, absolutely yes, unquestionably yes. But in case you’re not convinced yet, here’s a few ways learning to code has made me a much better designer:

### 1. Prototyping in HTML, JS and CSS is honestly sometimes faster.
Prototyping tools have gotten pretty drag and drop lately, and importing Sketch files into Invision, Marvel and Framer has become dreamily easy. 

But sometimes — especially when you’re designing animations or interactions — static prototypes just don’t cut it, and pulling out Adobe Illustrator and After Effects to show how selecting a filter will rearrange 30+ items on screen is going to take 20x longer than spinning up an index.html file, adding some CDN tags to jQuery and Masonry, and posting it on GitHub.

Plus, when the inevitable question, “Ohhhhh I like that, but what if it was slower/blue/faded out, too?” comes does the line, I find that it’s much easier to jump into a text editor and swap out a few variables than to dive back into the animation workflow again.

Plus, with tools like [Framer](https://framer.com/), you can start doing some incredibly cool things:

### 2. You will communicate better with developers, and you will make their lives easier. And people like it when you make their lives easier.

Everyone’s had that moment when a design comes back from dev, and you think, “Oh.. that’s… not what I meant at all.”

I’ve been on both sides of that conversation, and neither is fun.

Discussing the pro’s and con’s of how best to build out particular interactions is hard, and it’s even harder when two sides of the conversation are speaking completely different languages. Knowing the difference between a hard refresh and an AJAX filter, or what the limitations are when it comes to front-end javascript, or scratching the surface of the amazing and seemingly infinite ways you can use CSS is going to make those conversations easier. Understanding how programs store and retrieve information makes you more cognizant of how that information is displayed, and in my case, has made be much much better at information architecture design.

On top of which, knowing *roughly* how difficult it is to do something will save you tons of frustration in the long run: computers and humans fundamentally tackle problems in different ways, and it’s amazing how often things that intuitively seem very difficult are a breeze for a skilled developer. The reverse is also true: there are so, so many things that seem like they should be easy to do because humans are good at “fuzzy logic,” which are heinously complex for computers. 

In my experience, when you’re working against a budget for a client, being able to have intelligent conversations with developers about what’s “worth it” in terms of man hours vs. features that “would be awesome” will make or break your profitability. Having an understanding of how all the pieces fit together and what things are a “tall ask” has been crucial in working with developers to prioritize features that are low-cost and high-impact — instead of sending them off to slave away over something that could have been changed.

Plus — developers are people, too. It can suck to work hard on something and not have anyone understand how complicated it was to pull off. Having another person on the project who really “gets it” is a special kind of motivation that keeps you going when you’ve been tracking down that incomprehensible dependency bug for four hours.


### 3. Understanding how basic programming principles work is the difference between making great designs and making completely impossible designs.

Like a lot of front-end web developers, in the beginning, I struggled with the perennial question, “But which language should I learn?!” There are honestly so many things to learn, and so many new frameworks coming on the scene, that it gets complicated and overwhelming — fast.

The good news is that as a designer, learning a little bit of whatever is interesting to you will be hugely beneficial. Ruby, PHP, Javascript, Go, Java — whatever. But taking the time to understand how computers “think” has been the difference between some of my best designs and some of my “Okay, well, that was an interesting idea, but it’s also **completely** insane.”

### 4. When you have free time, you can make your own stuff.
